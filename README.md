# Generic Starter Files

Most of the projects I work on have a very similar structure. This repo was mainly for me, so I didn't have to recreate everything from scratch for all projects. Now it's turned into a repo for anyone needed a quick starting place for new projects. The idea behind these files is to be modified and molded into whatever environment you are working in. Let me break down a couple of key areas for you.

## Project Overview

This starter pack gets you with everything you need to get up and running quickly. It turns your `scss` into CSS, babels your JavaScript*, moves your html and php files, relocates your images, starts up a browser and has browser refresh and style hot loading!


## Project Structure

All of your source files live in the `src` directory. You have three main folders in here, `images` | `scripts` | `styles`.
