# Generic Starter Files

Most of the projects I work on have a very similar structure. And this repo was mainly for me, so I didn't have to recreate everything from scratch for every project. Now it's turned into a repo for anyone needed a quick starting place for new projects. This is meant to be a good starting place and meant to be modifiable to fit your needs.
